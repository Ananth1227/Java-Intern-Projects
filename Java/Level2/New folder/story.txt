The old man lived in a house as silent as snow. His days were a monotone rhythm of tea and shadows. A peculiar knock echoed one evening. Hesitantly, he opened. A small girl stood there, her eyes wide with wonder.

"Lost my doll," she whispered, her voice like wind chimes.

Intrigued, he followed her into the twilight. They searched beneath gnarled trees and in moonlit meadows. As the first stars appeared, they found her doll, nestled in a bed of violets.

The girl's laughter was like a sunbeam breaking through clouds. The old man felt a warmth he hadn't known in years. That night, as he watched her distant home, a star seemed to wink at him. Perhaps, just perhaps, life was about to change its melody.
